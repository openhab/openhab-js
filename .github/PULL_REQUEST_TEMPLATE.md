<!--
Thanks for contributing to the openHAB project!
Please describe the goal and effect of your PR here.
Pay attention to the below notes and to *the guidelines* for this repository.
Feel free to delete any comment sections in the template (starting with "<!--").

ATTENTION: Don't use "git merge" when working with your pull request branch!
This can clutter your Git history and make your PR unuseable.
Use "git rebase" instead. See this forum post for further details:
https://community.openhab.org/t/rebase-your-code-or-how-to-fix-your-git-history-before-requesting-a-pull/129358

Add one or more appropriate labels to make your PR show up in the release notes,
e.g. enhancement, bug, documentation, new feature.
This can only be done by yourself if you already contributed to this repo.

If your PR's code is not backward compatible with previous releases (which
should be avoided), add a message to the release notes by filing another PR:
https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/blob/main/distributions/openhab/src/main/resources/bin/update.lst

# Testing

It is a good practice to describe some tests so other people can use your tests and do not have to write new tests.
